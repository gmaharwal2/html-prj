In the 1990s, banks realized that the rising popularity of the World Wide Web gave them an added opportunity to advertise their services. Initially, they used the Web as another brochure, without interaction with the customer. Early sites featured pictures of the bank's officers or buildings, and provided customers with maps of branches and ATM locations, phone numbers to call for further information and simple listings of products.

Wells Fargo was the first U.S. bank to add account services to its website, in 1995. Other banks quickly followed suit. That same year Presidential became the first bank in the United States to open bank accounts over the Internet. According to research by Online Banking Report, by the end of 1999, less than 0.4% of households in the U.S. were using online banking. At the beginning of 2004, some 33 million U.S. households (31% of the market) were using one form or another of online banking. Five years later, 47% of Americans were banking online, according to a survey by Gartner Group.
