<li>It's generally secure. But make sure that the website you're using has a valid security certificate. This let's you know that the site is protected from cyber-thieves looking to steal your personal and financial information.</li>

<li>You have twenty-four-hour access. When your neighborhood bank closes, you can still access your account and make transactions online. It's a very convenient alternative for those that can't get to the bank during normal hours because of their work schedule, health or any other reason.</li>

<li>You can access your account from virtually anywhere. If you're on a business trip or vacationing away from home, you can still keep a watchful on your money and financial transactions - regardless of your location.</li>

<li>Conducting business online is generally faster than going to the bank. Long teller lines can be time-consuming, especially on a Pay Day. But online, there are no lines to contend with. You can access your account instantly and at your leisure.</li>


<li>Many features and services are typically available online. For example, with just a few clicks you can apply for loans, check the progress of your investments, review interest rates and gather other important information that may be spread out over several different brochures in the local bank.
